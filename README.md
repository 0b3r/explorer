# Keen IO Explorer

The Keen Explorer is an open source point-and-click interface for querying and visualizing your event data.

## Quick Setup

### TL;DR

  1. `cp demo/example_index.html demo/index.html`
  2. Add your Keen IO keys to demo/index.html
  3. `npm install`
  4. `npm -g install gulp` (if needed)
  5. `gulp` or `export PORT=8082; gulp`
  6. You can now view the demo locally at `http://localhost:8081/explorer` or your specified port.

### 1. Get your project ID & API keys
If you havenâ€™t done so already, [login to Keen IO to create a project](https://keen.io/add-project) for your app. You'll need a [Keen IO account](https://keen.io/signup?s=explorer) to create a project. The Project ID and API Keys are available on the Project Overview page. You will need these for the next steps.

### 2. Drop in the JavaScript, CSS and images

You can see a complete code example of all these resources being included [in our demo page here.](/demo/example_index.html)

#### CSS

Include a copy of Bootstrap 3, which you can do from the CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
```

Include a copy of the Keen.Explorer styling from this project, found under: `dist/keen-explorer.css`.

#### HTML

Have a div with an id that you'll use as the target to render out the app. A simple:

```html
<div id="content"></div>
```

will work just fine. All of the interface components will live under this div.

#### JavaScript

Include a copy of jQuery, which you can do from the Google CDN:
```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

Include a copy of Keen.js, the easiest way is to use our CDN version:
```html
<script src="https://d26b395fwzu5fz.cloudfront.net/3.1.0-beta/keen.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Include a copy of Keen.Explorer from this project, found under: `dist/keen-explorer.js`.

### 3. Configure a Keen.js client and initialize the Keen.Explorer app

Initialize a new Keen.js client and then pass that into the initialization of a new Keen.Explorer.App.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function(){
      client = new Keen({
        projectId: "your_project_id",
        readKey: "your_read_key",
        masterKey: "your_master_key",
        protocol: "https",
        host: "api.keen.io/3.0",
        requestType: "jsonp"
      });

      var app = new Keen.Explorer.App({
        client: client,
        targetId: 'content'
      });

      app.render(); // Render the app's UI into the targetId provided in the config.
    });
</script>
```

If you want the Explorer app to run on a path other than the root, you can pass in the `root` configuration option, eg: `root: '/your/custom/root/path'`.

You can read more about Keen.js here: [The Keen.js client library](https://github.com/keenlabs/keen-js/).

### 3. Optionally include Saved Queries support

Saved query support is optional. If you include it, you can persist the state of the query you're working with to be looked up at a later time. If you do not want to use saved queries, just do not include it in the Keen.Explorer.App initialization, like above.

To include saved queries, just set the `savedQueries` config variable to `true`. You *must* include a master key if you want saved queries support.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  $(document).ready(function(){
    client = new Keen({
      projectId: "your_project_id",
      readKey: "your_read_key",
      protocol: "https",
      host: "api.keen.io/3.0",
      requestType: "xhr"
    });

    var app = new Keen.Explorer.App({
      client: client,
      savedQueries: true, // saved queries are supported
      targetId: 'content'
    });

    app.render();
  });
</script>
```

## Forking the Project to Customizing and Contribute

If you want to customize this project or contribute, here is how to get started:

* clone the repo
* run `npm install` to install project dependencies
* update the `index.html` with your Project ID and API Keys

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function(){
      client = new Keen({
        projectId: "your_project_id",
        readKey: "your_read_key",
        masterKey: "your_master_key",
        protocol: "https",
        host: "api.keen.io/3.0",
        requestType: "jsonp"
      });

      var app = new Keen.Explorer.App({
        client: client,
        targetId: 'content'
      });

      app.render();
    });
</script>
```

### Building the project:

The project is built with   `Gulp.js`.

* Run `gulp` from the root directory of the project
* The demo app will be running on `http://localhost:8081/explorer`.

### Testing

##### Run Unit Tests
* Run `gulp test:unit` to run the unit tests.

##### Run Functional Tests
* Run `gulp test:functional` to run the functional tests.

##### Run In Browser Mocha Unit Tests

This isn't normally requried, but if you need to, you can run the tests in the browser.

* Run `gulp`
* Run a server on another port, we use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.org/package/http-server) on port `8082`
* See the mocha unit test suite run on `http://localhost:8082/test/unit/`

### Is this open source Keen Explorer different than the one on keen.io?

Nope! We have recently moved all our development on the Keen Explorer to this open source version.  

If you have any questions about using the open source Data Explorer feel free to contact us anytime at [team@keen.io](mailto:team@keen.io). 

### Contributing:

Would an animated GIF be more informative than a screenshot? Then we recommend [Recordit](http://recordit.co/).

## Tech

These are the major technologies used in the project.

* [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) for UI Components & input handling
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) for dependency management.
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to compile modules for use in the browser
* [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/) for a task/build runner
